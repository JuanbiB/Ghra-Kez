First Individual CS Project 

Written in Python as a final project for my Intro to Computer Science class. 
Not the best display of code efficiency, but a definitely an interesting milestone in my coding career.

Always been an avid gamer and so with the skills I had I tried my hand at coding my own version of one of the pioneers of gaming: text adventures. The user is set and guided in an imaginary dungeon from which they must escape from with commands and cunning decisions. There's a combat and looting system.
